# Development Environment

I built this project using VSCode with the SQL Server extension
I wrote this project using PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL

# Useful Websites


- [PHP Web Site](https://www.php.net/)
- [W3 Schools PHP](https://www.w3schools.com/php/)

# Future Work

- This is built using pure PHP, HTML, and CSS. I could probably use some libraries or frameworks to make it more outstanding in the design
- I want to try also using a NoSQL database for other queries that don't have the same information on the tables- I could use some other super global variables to get faster responses
